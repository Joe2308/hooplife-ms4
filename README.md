# Wireframes:
My initial wireframes and database schemas were sketched on paper and when I was happy I was going in the correct direction I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to finalise my mockups for the front end. Having viewed the websites of major sporting Ecommerce players such as Nike and JD Sports, I decided I wanted my website to be simple with minimal but popular products that would sell while also give a retro feel to the design.
